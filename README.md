# Sending-and-Receiving-An-Audio-Signal
***Record a voice and send it from one city to another city by designing an appropriate carrier wave and detect the sent signal properties.***<br/>
<br/>
We canâ€™t send the whole audio signal because of the shortage of    
equipment, so in this project we use sampling and sending a discrete signal     
which can be reconstructed in the Destination city.
