# Sending-and-Receiving-An-Audio-Signal
***Recording a voice and sending it from one city to another city by designing an appropriate carrier wave.***<br/>
We canâ€™t send the whole audio signal because of the shortage of    
equipment, so in this MATLAB code we use sampling and sending a discrete signal     
which can be reconstructed in the Destination city.
